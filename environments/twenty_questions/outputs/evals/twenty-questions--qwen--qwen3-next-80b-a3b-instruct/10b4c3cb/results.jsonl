Maybe the user meant \u201cnot a large geographical feature.\u201d I may have misinterpreted earlier.  \n\nLet me try a new angle: is it something that is **not found on Earth at all**? But I asked \u201cfrom outer space\u201d and got \u201cno,\u201d so it must be terrestrial.  \n\nWhat if it\u2019s something like **a piece of the Earth\u2019s crust that was ejected and fell back**?
