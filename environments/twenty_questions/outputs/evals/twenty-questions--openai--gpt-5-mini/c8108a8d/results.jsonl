We asked \"Is it used to indicate rules\/restrictions?\" yes. We asked if it's speed limit earlier and that guess was incorrect.

Remaining possibilities: numeric identifier (route number, mile marker) but earlier we had 'not directional' and 'indicates rules\/restrictions'. Could our earlier \"indicates rules\/restrictions\" be misinterpreted? It was from earlier Q: \"Does it indicate rules, restrictions, or commands?\" user answered Yes. So must be regulatory. What regulatory rectangular signs with numbers remain? \"Minimum speed\" (speed-related), \"Advisory speed\" (yellow diamond, typically not rectangular), \"Maximum height\/weight\/length\" we asked vehicle restrictions - No. \"Distance to hazard\" No. \"Speed limit\" we guessed - No. \"Truck speed limit\" maybe a sign applies to trucks specifically? That would be vehicle restriction. \"Sharp turn advisory 35\" those are advisory (yellow) and not regulatory. Could be \"No vehicles over x tons\" already vehicle restriction. Hmm.\n\nMaybe it's a rectangular regulatory sign that displays a number like \"Route 66\" \u2014 that's a route marker, informational\/directional; but earlier we said not directional.

Alternatively \"Mile marker\" is informational, not regulatory; but the user earlier answered that it indicates rules\u2014maybe misremembered.\n\nWe should ask whether the sign marks a specific route or road number (route\/shield).
